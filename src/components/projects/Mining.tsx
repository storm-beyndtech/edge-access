							Mining is critical to securing the minerals essential for everyday life and essential to be able
							to build renewable energy projects. The mining industry produces the primary products required
							for the generation, distribution and delivery of renewable energy. The first step in the supply
							chain to create solar panels and wind turbines and EV batteries begins with mining companies
							like Blue Scope, Atlas and Roy Hill.
